## Connecting to an external WiFi source
### Using this router as a repeater
Log into the router

On the left hand side of the router admin page, click *Internet*.

On this page, there are multiple ways to connect this router to the internet.
1. The first is through an Ethernet cable. Simply connect an Ethernet cable from the default gateway (WiFi you indend on using) to the WAN port of the router.
2. The second is as a repeater. This is what this section will focus on.
3. The next is as a 3G/4G modem. This requires extra hardware so we will not focus on this.
4. The final method is tethering through a smartphone. This method is very similar to a mobile hotspot, but will use the router as a means for swiching data over the LAN, instead of the smartphone.

In the *Repeater* section, click *Scan*. This will open a new page and will scan for available networks nearby.

From the SSID dropdown menu, select the network you wish to repeat from. Enter the password for that network. Select *Remember* if you wish to remember this network for future use. Then hit connect. A Success notification will appear upon successful connection.
